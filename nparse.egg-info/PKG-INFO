# nbparse

nbparse is a library for english learners, who struggle with reading notebooks.

# Usage

```
$ nbparse <notebook which you want>.ipynb
```

And then `<notebook which you want>.md` and `<notebook which you want>.py` is overwritten automatically.

I think it is more lighter to read i.e. more legible.

# Motivation

- I want to enjoy Kaggle, but it's too difficult to read notebook from scratch.
    - Especially in Kaggle, public notebooks are very useful but it is too long for me to read one time.
- In addition to this, I use no-high spec PC and I'm not good at some libraries.
- Therefore, I would like to the following:
    1. I want to make notebook lighter
        - it's ok to use no-high spec PC
    2. I want to make the history which I read easier.
        - in order to 
            - memorize phrases or words
            - to write down the usage of library.
